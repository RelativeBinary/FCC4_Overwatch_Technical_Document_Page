//for each role section the lists will be generated based from objects with ajax
//there will be role object > role-offensive > role-defensive > role-etc > role-heros >role-heros-heroname
//bunch of switch statements which will allocate information e.g
//if role = tanks then for tanks.offensive do x, for tanks.defensive do x, for tanks.etc do x
// for tanks.heros.length() get tanks.heros[i] = currHero for currHero do x
